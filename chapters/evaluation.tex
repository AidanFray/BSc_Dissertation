%In this chapter you must evaluate your overall project achievement, and provide a clear statement of where the delivered results stand in relation to the original project goals. You should also provide an outline of any further potential work which you can foresee as beneficial to the future development of your project.
\chapter{Evaluation}


%Project Achievements:
%You should consider your original goals and state clearly which have or have not been fully or partially met, and discuss reasons for any significant variance.
\section{Project Achievements}


%UI design:
%If your software includes user interaction then you could also include a discussion (supported by diagrams) of decisions that you have made regarding the user interface.
\section{UI design}

%Further work:
%You should identify any specific areas of the existing product where further work is required, either to address known bugs or omissions, or to improve the system â€“ for example an area you developed at an early stage may in hindsight have been structured in a better way, although it is still perfectly functional.
%You should also provide an outline of any additional areas of potential development you can envisage beyond the initial goals, where the system might be extended in future for greater functionality.
