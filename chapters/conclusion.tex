The project as mentioned above has succeeded in achieving its goals, it was able to provide a test network where various forms of degradation were performed on the network using a script hosted on a small Raspberry Pi router. The script is supported by a Linux OS and performs most of its functionality utilising a section in the Linux Kernel known as the NFQUEUE. Although further improvements were discussed above the project was fully functional and the tool can be used to simulate degradation very effectively.
