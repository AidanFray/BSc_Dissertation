\chapter{Aim and Objectives}

\comments{This section should define the overall aim of the project and clearly state the individual, measurable objectives that you have set for the project (objectives should have a deliverable outcome associated with them). In short, this section should clearly identify exactly what it is that you are intending to achieve in the project.}


State the overall aim of your project here. This can carry over on to several lines if you want.

Some text here to indicate that the above aim will be met by the following numbered objectives. Write approximately one sentence to outline what the objective is here. Include as many objectives as you think reasonable but remember that these are not as fine grained as the tasks which will come later.

\paragraph{Objective Title Goes Here If You Can Think Of One.} 
Here you should be writing a more detailed description of what this objective is. It should explain how it contributes towards the aim, what the deliverable(s) of the objective is/are, and how you intend to evaluate it.

\paragraph{Objective Title Goes Here If You Can Think Of One.} 
Do this for each one of your objectives.
