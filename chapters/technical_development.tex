%In this section you will discuss the Technical Development related to your project.
%In one or more chapters you must describe fully the design and development strategies you have adopted and the results achieved.  You may refer to appropriate User and System documentation presented as appendices to avoid repeating extensive detail, so you can focus here instead on a discussion of your reasons for adopting the techniques and strategies you have followed.
%Again, it is difficult to give prescriptive guidance on the subsection structure you might adopt, as this will depend on the nature and content of your project.  However, you will probably want at least to consider sections addressing issues of System Design; Implementation; Testing.  If there is a lot to cover in any of these areas, it may warrant presentation as a full chapter rather than a section.
\chapter{Technical Development}



%System design:
%This can include UML diagrams such as class diagrams, use case diagrams, activity diagrams, etc.
%If you find that these are taking up a lot of space/words, then you should prioritise and relegate where appropriate to the appendices. 
%This should not just be a list of unexplained diagrams, but should rather include discussions of the most interesting parts of your design, tying them to your background and objectives.
\section{System design}



%UI design:%
%If your software includes user interaction then you could also include a discussion (supported by diagrams) of decisions that you have made regarding the user interface.%
\section{UI design}



%Experimental design:
%If you project includes any experiments, including but not limited to user testing, then you can discuss their design here. Note that again this does not exist in a vacuum and should be tied to your research.
\section{Experiential design}



%Test design and system testing:
%Testing is an extremely important part of any software project and should not be a tacked on afterthought. You can include here a discussion of the design of any tests that you intend to carry out on your project. It would not be appropriate to include an exhaustive list of all the individual tests that you wish to conduct (consider the appendices for this) but examples would be useful to illustrate your discussion.
%You should review how you have approached the testing and quality assurance of your delivered product, including relevant choice of incremental and/or integration testing, test scenarios, sample datasets, etc. as appropriate,  Exhaustive reproduction of extensive test records is not required, but sample evidence should be used to support your discussion.
\section{Test design and system testing}



%System Implementation:$
%You should review how you have implemented your project system, discussing any areas of the implementation which might for example involve code or processes which are not immediately obvious in structure or operation, where you have had to innovate or develop particular approaches.  Again, you should refer to relevant diagrams of code or object structures which should be included in documentation as appended.
