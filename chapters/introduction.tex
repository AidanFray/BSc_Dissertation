\chapter{Introduction}
Networks and their functionality play a crucial role in today's internet infrastructure. Networks relay packets and allow communication between computers from opposite sides of the globe. This paper will discuss and explore the effects of degradation on a live network, and how these effects can be reduced or negated. 

The live network will be a simulation of network traffic, this traffic will be routed through a custom router running on a small Raspberry Pi. This Raspberry Pi will run the degradation tool that will allow the control of network conditions. 

Issues may arise from various aspects of the project, the first being the accuracy in simulation of network traffic may pose issues. Other potential problems may come from the searching of effective practises to negate hostile network conditions, and other issues involving stability and scalability of the tool therefore, its max capacity needs exploring. These issues will be discussed later.
